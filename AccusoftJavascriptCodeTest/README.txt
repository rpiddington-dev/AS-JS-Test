This is Accusoft's take-home review test. This test was designed to focus on debugging, research, refactoring, and best practices for coding in JavaScript.

This test is to be completed by yourself, with no help from anyone else. 

With this test, we are looking at three things:

1. Debugging. The code you're given will have errors and incorrect logic (it won't do what it's supposed to). Find them and fix them.

2. Refactoring. We're giving you a partially written project, but every line of code you submit will be reviewed as if you wrote it. There are multiple instances of poorly factored code, use your best judgement to fix them. Treat this project as if you're inheriting it -- clean it up until you're proud of it. 

3. Best Practices. You will be rewriting some existing code, and writing your own code. Keep good coding practices in mind when doing this.

For this code test, please do the following:

Fix these Items:
    1. Get the different Canvas tabs functional
    2. Fix the erase Tool
    3. Fix the Text Tool
    4. Fix the Photo Upload Tool

Please implement two interesting features for the right-click menu that has been implemented.

Additionally, go through the project, remove any additional bugs you find, refactor, and optimize the existing code.

You are also required to create a running log of the changes made to the sample project.
